## Music Recommendation System

Music recommendation systems are becoming increasingly popular in today's digital world because they help users discover new music that they might like. Machine learning is a powerful tool for developing effective music recommendation systems because it enables these systems to learn from the data they receive and make personalised recommendations for each user. To make personalised recommendations for each user, these systems employ a variety of techniques, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. This project will explore the use of machine learning in music recommendation systems, including the techniques employed, the difficulties encountered, and the potential benefits to users.

### Dataset

For this project, we used Spotify dataset from Kaggle. The main dataset contains 19 columns, and 170653 rows includes data from 1920 to 2020. The description of which is given below. The metadata includes four csv files which gives detailed information about songsâ€™ artists, genre, and release year. The main dataset is used for building music recommendation system, while the metadata is used for exploratory data analysis to find the hidden patterns of the data.
